# Python cheat sheet
## Basics
### Print
Prints a string into the console.
````python
print("Hello world")
````
### Input
Prints a string into the console, and ask the user for a string input.
````python
input("What's your name?")
````
### Comments
Adding a # symbol in font of text lets you make comments on a line of code.
The computer will ignore your comments.
````python
# This is a comment print("This is code")
````
### Variables
A variable give a name to a piece of data. Like a box with a label, it tells you what's inside the box.
````python
my_name = "Luis"
my age = 23
````
### The += Operator
This is a convient way of saying. "take the previous value and add to it".
````python
my_age = 12
my_age += 4
# my_age is now 16
````
## Data types
### Integers
Integers are whole numbers.
````python
my_number = 354
````
### Floating Point Numbers
Floats are numbers with decimal places. When you do a calculation that results in a fraction e.g 4/3 the result will always be a floating point number.
````python
my_float = 3.14159
````
### Strings
A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.
````python
my_string = "Hello"
````
